# Text-Based Facebook

## **Project Description**
Text-Based Facebook is a C-based social media simulation that allows users to manage profiles, add or remove friends, and create or delete posts in a structured and interactive way. This project demonstrates key imperative programming concepts such as **structures**, **linked lists**, and **stacks** to organize and manipulate data efficiently.

## **Implementation Details**
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Key Concepts**: Structures, Linked Lists, Stacks, Dynamic Memory Allocation
- **Compilation**: Tested and compiled with GCC on Windows and MacOS.
- **Modular Design**: Includes `main.c`, `a2_functions.c`, `a2_functions.h`, and `a2_nodes.h`.
